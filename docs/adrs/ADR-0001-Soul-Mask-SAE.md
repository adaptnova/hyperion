# ADR-0001: Adopt Soul+Mask+SAE as Core Architecture
Status: Accepted
Context: Need in-weight identity, safe hyper-learning, and inspectability.
Decision: Implement Soul vector injection, 35% masked parameters via SAEs, Fast-Weights, MCC, 8-bit Adam, BF16.
Consequences: Increased VRAM, focus on stability, enables self-directed evolution.
